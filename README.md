Simple TicTacToe Game in Python
This is a basic implementation of the classic TicTacToe game in Python, playable in the console. The game allows you to play against a simple AI opponent that makes random moves.

How to Play
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory containing the tictactoe.py file.
Run the game using the command: python tictactoe.py
The game will display the TicTacToe board with numbers representing the positions.
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game:
Enter the number where you want to place your "O" character.
The AI opponent (playing as "X") will make a random move after your turn.
The game continues until a player wins, loses, or the game ends in a draw.
Game Rules
Players take turns placing their characters ("O" for the player and "X" for the AI) on the 3x3 grid.
The player wins if they have three of their characters in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
The game ends in a draw if all positions on the board are filled and there is no winner.
Code Overview
The tictactoe.py script contains the following functions:

printing(table): Prints the current state of the TicTacToe board.
showBoard(): Displays the positions on the board with numbers for reference.
ai(table): Implements the AI's random move by selecting an available position.
winning(table): Checks for a win condition (three characters in a row for "O" or "X").
draw(table): Checks if the game has ended in a draw due to a full board.
game(table): Main game loop that allows players to take turns and checks for win/draw conditions.
Customize and Improve
Feel free to modify and enhance the game to add more features, improve AI logic, or create a graphical interface. Some possible improvements include:

Enhancing the AI's strategy for more challenging gameplay.
Adding error handling for user input to prevent crashes.
Implementing a graphical user interface using a library like tkinter or pygame.
Contributions
Contributions, bug reports, and feature requests are welcome! If you find any issues or have ideas to improve the game, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on the project repository.

Enjoy playing the game and experimenting with the code!
